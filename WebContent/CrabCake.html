<h1>CrabCake Recipe</h1>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
	<li>1 lb jumbo lump or backfin crab meat</li>
	<li>2 slices bread or bread crumbs</li>
	<li>1 tbsp. mayonnaise (light or regular)</li>
	<li>1 tbsp. Dijon mustard</li>
	<li>1 tbsp. Dijon mustard</li>
	<li>1 tbsp. snipped parsley </li>
	<li>1 egg (or substitute for special diets)</li>
	<li>tartar sauce or cocktail sauce</li>
</ul>
<h2><p>Directions:</p></h2>
<p>Beat the egg in a bowl. Trim the crusts from the bread and break the slices into small pieces. Add these pieces to the <br> 
egg. Mix in the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Chesapeake seasoning and parsley, and beat well.</p>
<p>Place the crabmeat in a bowl and pour the egg mixture over the top. Gently toss or fold the ingredients together,<br> 
 taking care not to break up the lumps of crabmeat.</p>
<p>Form the cakes by hand into patties about 3 inches around and 3/4-inch thick. Shape should be like a cookie, not like<br>a meatball or golf ball. Place the cakes in the refrigerator for at least 45 minutes before cooking. This is very<br>
  important so the cakes don't fall apart. </p>
<h2><p>Broil the Crab Cakes:</p></h2>
<p>Slip them under a preheated broiler until nicely browned, turning to cook evenly, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side.</p>
<h2><p>Or saute:</p></h2>	
<p>Heat a small amount of butter or olive oil in a skillet and saute the cakes, turning several times, until golden brown or<br>about 8 minutes total cooking time. </p>
<p>Serve at once with tartar sauce, mustard, or cocktail sauce on the side.</p>
